:title: Django Project Release History

I was curious so I went ahead and found out all of the official `Django
<http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_. releases and  when they were released and how long it took between each release.

There have been 7 major releases and 8 minor releases in the past 5 years. I wonder how this 
compares to other projects like `Ruby on Rails
<http://rubyonrails.org/>`_.
