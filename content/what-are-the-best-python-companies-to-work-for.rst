:title: What are the best python companies to work for?

I was looking at the pycon US 2012 website when I stumbled upon the huge list of `sponsors <https://us.pycon.org/2012/sponsors/>`_, which is really impressive. It got me thinking. Are all of these companies using python? If so, which ones are the best companies to work for?

If it was up to you, and location and money wasn't a factor, what company would you work for and why? If you already work at one of these companies, can you share what it is you use python for, and what it is like working there? 

Here is a list of companies that use Python, in no particular order (most of these are pycon US 2012 sponsors). If I missed a company, please let me know.
