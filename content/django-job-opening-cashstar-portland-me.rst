:title: Django Job Opening @ CashStar.com (Portland, ME)


I work for a company called `CashStar <http://CashStar.com>`_, most people have never heard of us, but a lot of people have used our products without even knowing it. CashStar is the man behind the curtain so to speak. We created an e-gift card platform that is used by some of the largest companies in the United States. Here is a short list of some of our customers: The Home Depot, Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Staples, Coach, Starbucks, CVS, Chilis, Regal Cinemas, Pottery Barn, The CheeseCake Factory, Dell, Pizza Hut, and many more. To see the full list follow this link: http://www.cashstar.com/all-egift-card-clients/

Another thing that most people don't know is that we power that platform using the awesome python framework called `Django <http://DjangoProject.com>`_. Using Python and Django, our small engineering team in Portland, Maine has taken our startup which didn't exist 3 years ago and turned it into a leader in the electronic gift card market. Due to this phenomenal growth, we need to expand our engineering team. We are currently looking for developers as well as QA folks to join our team. You will need to work on site in Portland Maine, and be legally allowed to work in the United States.
