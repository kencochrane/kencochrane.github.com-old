:title: DjangoMaine.com - Django User group in Portland Maine

When I was at DjangoCon a few weeks ago, it was great hanging out with all of the fellow Djangonauts talking about Django and all of other great technologies. Now that I'm home, I have decided to get off my butt and do something I should have done a while ago. 

Without further ado, I am pleased to announce the creation of DjangoMaine.com, a new Django user group based in Portland Maine. We plan on meeting monthly to discuss Django and other python related technologies. We are currently looking for members, and topic ideas for future meetings. If you have any ideas or you are interesting in hearing more, check out our website http:///www.DjangoMaine.com
